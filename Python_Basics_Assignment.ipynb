It is popular due to its simplicity and readability (syntax similar to English), vast standard library, extensive third-party libraries (e.g., for data science, web development, AI), cross-platform compatibility, and a large, supportive community."

If the `if` condition is `False`, Python then checks the `elif` condition. If the `elif` condition is `True`, its corresponding block of code is executed. You can have multiple `elif` statements after an `if` statement. If none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are met, the `else` block (if present) is executed."
